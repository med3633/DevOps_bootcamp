Can we use multiple providers in the same configuration directory?

==> yes

We have a new configuration directory located at the path /root/terraform-projects/multi-provider. Inspect this directory and find out the number of providers initialized.

Don't run the terraform init command yet!

resource "local_file" "pet_name" {
	    content = "We love pets!"
	    filename = "/root/pets.txt"
}


resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
	      prefix = "Mrs"
	      separator = "."
	      length = "1"
}

==> 0

Now, run the terraform init command and inspect the .terraform/providers directory. Count the number of plugins downloaded.
==> 2

Now, Navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/MPL. Create a new configuration file called pet-name.tf.
This file should make use of the local_file and random_pet resource type with the below requirements:

local_file resource details:

Resource name = "my-pet"

File name = "/root/pet-name"

Content = "My pet is called finnegan!!"


random_pet resource details:

Resource name = "other-pet"

Length = "1"

Prefix = "Mr"

Separator = "."


Once the configuration file has been created, use the terraform workflow to create this resource.

resource "local_file" "my-pet" {
    filename = "/root/pet-name"
    content = "My pet is called finnegan!!"
  
}

resource "random_pet" "other-pet" {
    length = "1"
    prefix = "Mr"
    separator = "."
  
}

Now change into the directory /root/terraform-projects/provider and inspect the file cloud-provider.tf.
What is the instance_type configured with the resource type called aws_instance?

Don't worry if you are not familiar with the aws providers. We will cover it later on.


resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
	  ami       =  "ami-0eda277a0b884c5ab" 
	  instance_type = "t2.large"
}


resource "aws_ebs_volume" "ec2_volume" {
	  availability_zone = "eu-west-1"
	  size  =    10
}


What is the name of the resource configured with the resource type kubernetes_namespace in kube.tf file within the same directory?


resource "local_file" "data" {
	filename = "/root/k8s.txt"
	content = "kubernetes the hard way!"
}


resource "kubernetes_namespace" "dev" {
  metadata {
    name = "development"
  }
}

==> dev
Let's get some more practice! Now navigate to the directory path /root/terraform-projects/provider-a. Create a configuration file called code.tf.

Using the local_file resource type, write the resource block with the below requirements into the file:

Resource name = iac_code

File name = /opt/practice

Content = Setting up infrastructure as code


When ready, only run the terraform init command, we will run the terraform apply command later on.

resource "local_file" "iac_code" {
	  filename = "/opt/practice"
	  content = "Setting up infrastructure as code"
}


resource "random_string" "iac_random" {
  length = 10
  min_upper = 5
}

We have made some changes to the configuration file. Are you able to run terraform apply command?
==> no
