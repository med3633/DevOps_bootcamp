Which of the following is not a valid variable type?
==> item
Which one of the below is not a valid data type in terraform?
==> array
Navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/variables. Which type does the variable called number belong to?
variable "name" {
     type = string
     default = "Mark"
  
}
variable "number" {
     type = bool
     default = true
  
}
variable "distance" {
     type = number
     default = 5
  
}
variable "jedi" {
     type = map
     default = {
     filename = "/root/first-jedi"
     content = "phanius"
     }
  
}

variable "gender" {
     type = list(string)
     default = ["Male", "Female"]
}
variable "hard_drive" {
     type = map
     default = {
          slow = "HHD"
          fast = "SSD"
     }
}
variable "users" {
     type = set(string)
     default = ["tom", "jerry", "pluto", "daffy", "donald", "jerry", "chip", "dale"]

  
}
==> bool
How would you fetch the value of the key called slow from the variable called hard_drive in a terraform configuration?

This variable is defined in the file variables.tf.
==> var.hard_drive["slow"]


What is the type of variable called users?

set(string)

However, this variable has been defined incorrectly! Identify the mistake.

==> duplicated elements

What is the value for the argument called content used in the resource block for the resource jedi?

resource "local_file" "jedi" {
     filename = "/root/first-jedi"
     content = "phanius"
}

==>phanius

Now, let's update this resource and add variables instead. Use the default value declared in the variable called jedi.


This variable is a map. For the argument called content use the value of the key by the same name.
And, similarly, for the argument called filename use the value by the same name.


When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply to create this resource.

resource "local_file" "jedi" {
     filename = var.jedi["filename"]
     content = var.jedi["content"]
}



What is the index of the element called Female in the variable called gender?
=> 1
