When we start off and create a configuration in terraform, what is the workspace that is created, to begin with?
==> default
Navigate to the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire. We have a few configuration files already created here. How may workspaces are created for this configuration currently?
### variable.tf
variable "region" {
    type = map
    default = {
        "us-payroll" = "us-east-1"
        "uk-payroll" = "eu-west-2"
        "india-payroll" = "ap-south-1"
    }

}
variable "ami" {
    type = map
    default = {
        "us-payroll" = "ami-24e140119877avm"
        "uk-payroll" = "ami-35e140119877avm"
        "india-payroll" = "ami-55140119877avm"
    }
}
==> 1

Create three new workspaces called us-payroll, uk-payroll and india-payroll.
==> Run the following commands:

terraform workspace new us-payroll

terraform workspace new uk-payroll

terraform workspace new india-payroll

Now, switch to the workspace called us-payroll.
==> Run: terraform workspace select us-payroll

Where would the state file for the workspace called india-payroll be stored??

Choose the correct path relative to the current configuration directory (/root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire)

=> tfstate.d/india-payroll

Let's now write the main.tf file to make use of the same module that we saw in the terraform modules lecture.

The project-sapphire configuration directory will be used to deploy the same payroll application stack in different regions.

The module is located at the path /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app.

Inside the configuration directory, we have already added the variables.tf and the provider.tf file. Inspect them.

What type of variable is region?
==> ## variable.tf
variable "app_region" {
    default = "us-east-1"
}
variable "ami" {
    type = string
    default = "ami-24e140119877avm"
}
variable "bucket" {
    default = "flexit-payroll-alpha-22001c"
}

==> map

What is the default value of the key called india-payroll for the variable region?

==> ap-south-1

What is the default value of the key called india-payroll for the variable ami?
==> ami-55140119877avm

Now, update the main.tf of the root module to call the child module located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app. Adhere to the following specifications:

module name: payroll_app
This module expects two mandatory arguments:

a. app_region - use the values from variable called region

b. ami - use the values from the variable called ami
The values for these two arguments should be selected based on the workspace you are on.


For example, if on us-payroll workspace, the app_region should be us-east-1 and the ami ami-24e140119877avm OR for uk-payroll, the app_region should be eu-west-2 and the ami ami-35e140119877avm e.t.c .

Once ready, run terraform init. You don't have to create(apply) the resources yet!
Refer to the README.md file located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app to see how to use this module.

==> module "payroll_app" {
  source = "/root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app"
  app_region = lookup(var.region, terraform.workspace)
  ami        = lookup(var.ami, terraform.workspace)
}

Now, using the same configuration, create the resources on all three workspaces that you created earlier!

==> Run: terraform workspace select us-payroll; terraform apply
,
then terraform workspace select uk-payroll; terraform apply

and finally terraform workspace select india-payroll; terraform apply (In any order)
