Which location is the terraform state file stored by default?
==> inside the configuration directory
Which option should we use to disable state?
==> we cannot disable state
Which format is the state file stored in by default?
==> JSON
Which of the following commands does NOT refresh the state?
==> terraform init
What is the name of the state file that is created by default?
==> terraform.tfstate
Navigate to the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-flash we have created a few configuration files here.
The directory has been initialized and the provider plugins downloaded inside the .terraform directory.
However, there is no terraform.tfstate file created. Why is that?
==> terraform apply was not run
Run the terraform show command and identify the id created for the resource called speed_force.
==> terraform show 
=> no detail there is no state

Now, run terraform apply in this directory.

Now, check terraform show again. What is the value of id for the resource called speed_force?

We have just added a new configuration file called aws-infra.tf into this configuration directory and provisioned the resources.

These are AWS resources. Don't worry if they are unfamiliar to you, we will soon be learning about them in the upcoming lectures!
resource "aws_instance" "dev-server" {
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    ami         = "ami-02cff456777cd"
}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "falshpoint"  {
    bucket = "project-flashpoint-paradox"
}

Inspect the terraform.tfstate file or run terraform show command.

You will notice that all the attribute details for all the resources created by this configuration is now printed on the screen!


Among them is an EC2 Instance which is created by the resource called dev-server. See if you can find out the private_ip for the instance that was created.
