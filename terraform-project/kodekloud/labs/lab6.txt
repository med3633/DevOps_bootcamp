What is the resource_type of the resource that's currently defined in the main.tf file?

If unsure, refer to the documentation. Documentation tab is available at the top right panel.
 resource "time_static" "time_update" {
}
==> time_static

As you can see, the resource block is empty. This is because time_static does not need any arguments to be supplied to work.

When applied as it is, terraform creates a logical resource locally (similar to random_pet) with the current time.

Which of the following attributes are exported by the time_static resource?

If unsure, refer to the documentation. Documentation tab is available at the top right panel.

==> id

How do we refer to the attribute called id using a reference expression?

==> time_static.update[]

Now, update the main.tf file and add a new local_file resource called time with the following requirements:

filename: /root/time.txt
content: Time stamp of this file is <id from time_update resource>


Use a reference expression and interpolation.

When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.

resource "local_file" "time" {
  filename = "/root/time.txt"
  content = "Time stamp of this file is ${time_static.time_update.id}"

 }
 resource "time_static" "time_update" {
}

What is the attribute called id that is created for the local file resource called time?

Make use of the terraform show command and identify the attribute values.
