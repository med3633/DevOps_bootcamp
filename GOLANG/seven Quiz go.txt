What would be the output of the following comparison -


func main() {
        var a int = 12
        var b int = 12
        fmt.Println(a <= b)

        a = 20
        fmt.Println(a <= b)

        b = 100
        fmt.Println(a <= b)

        c := 0
        fmt.Println(a <= c)

}
==> true,false,true,false
