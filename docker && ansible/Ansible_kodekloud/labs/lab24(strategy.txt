Which of the following is not a valid strategy in Ansible?

Which of the following is the default strategy configured by Ansible.
==> linear
What is the default value for forks configured in Ansible?
==> 5
There are three nodes we are managing using Ansible. All of them are already added in ~/playbooks/inventory file present on Ansible controller. We have a playbook at path ~/playbooks/httpd.yml to install/configure httpd web server on all managed nodes. Update the playbook to use free strategy.
---
- name: Install httpd
  hosts: all
  strategy: free
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Install htpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: start service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
Revert the previous change made to the playbook ~/playbooks/httpd.yml to remove the free strategy and let Ansible use the default linear strategy. Make changes in this playbook to process only 1 server in a single batch i.e Ansible must execute tasks on a single server at a time.
