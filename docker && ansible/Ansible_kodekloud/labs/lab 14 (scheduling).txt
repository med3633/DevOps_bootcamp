Create a playbook ~/playbooks/lastlog.yml to add a cron job Clear Lastlog on node00 to empty the /var/log/lastlog logs file. The job must run at 12am everyday.


You can use the command echo “” > /var/log/lastlog to empty the lastlog file and schedule should be 0 0 * * *.

---
- name: Create a cron job to clear last log
  hosts: node00
  tasks:
   - name: Create cron job
     cron:
       name: "Clear Lastlog"
       minute: "0"
       hour: "0"
       job: echo "" > /var/log/lastlog

We have a script /root/free.sh on node00 that is used to check the free system memory. We would like to create a cron Free Memory Check to execute this script after every 2 hour (i.e 12am, 2am, 4am etc), the command to execute the script is sh /root/free.sh and schedule should be 0 */2 * * *.


You can create a playbook ~/playbooks/script_cron.yml for this.


---
- name: Create a cron job to run free.sh script
  hosts: node00
  tasks:
   - name: Create cron job
     cron:
       name: "Free Memory Check"
       minute: "0"
       hour: "*/2"
       job: "sh /root/free.sh"

We had a different cron earlier by the name Check Memory, to execute a different script - /root/free.sh on node00. That job was configured to run every 1 hour. However as we have now a new Cronjob configured let us get rid of the old one. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/remove_cron.yml to remove this cron from node00.

---
- name: remove cron job from node00
  hosts: node00
  tasks:
  - name: Remove cron job
    cron:
      name: "Check Memory"
      state: absent

Due to some disk space limitations, we want to cleanup the /tmp location on node00 host after every reboot. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/reboot.yml to add a cron named cleanup on node00 that will execute after every reboot and will clean /tmp location.


The command should be rm -rf /tmp/*.

---
- name: Cleanup /tmp after every reboot
  hosts: node00
  tasks:
   - cron:
      name: cleanup
      job: rm -rf /tmp/*
      special_time: reboot

On node00 we want to keep the installed packages up to date, so we would like to run yum updates regularly. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/yum_update.yml and create a cron job as described below:

a. Do not add cron directly using crontab instead create a cron file /etc/cron.d/ansible_yum.

b. The cron must run on every Sunday at 8:05 am.

c. The name of the cron must be yum update.

d. Cron should be added for user root


Use command yum -y update

---
- name: Create cron for yum
  hosts: node00
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Creates a cron
      cron:
        name: yum update
        weekday: 0
        minute: 5
        hour: 8
        user: root
        job: "yum -y update"
        cron_file: ansible_yum
