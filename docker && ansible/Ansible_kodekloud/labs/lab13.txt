Create an inventory file under ~/playbooks directory on Ansible controller host and add web1 as managed node. IP address of the web1 node is 172.20.1.100, SSH user is root and password is Passw0rd.


Create a playbook ~/playbooks/zip.yml to make a zip archive opt.zip of /opt directory on web1 node and save it under /root directory on web1 node itself.

On Ansible controller, we have a zip archive local.zip. We want to extract its contents on web1 under /tmp directory. Create a playbook local.yml under ~/playbooks directory to complete the task.

---
- name: extract local.zip to web1
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
  - unarchive:
      src: local.zip
      dest: /tmp

On web1 node we have an archive data.tar.gz under /root directory, extract it under /srv directory by developing a playbook ~/playbooks/data.yml and make sure data.tar.gz archive is removed after that.

---
- name: Extract data.tar.gz on web1
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
  - unarchive:
      src: /root/data.tar.gz
      dest: /srv
      remote_src: yes

  - file: path=/root/data.tar.gz state=absent

Create a playbook download.yml under ~/playbooks directory to download and extract the https://github.com/kodekloudhub/Hello-World/archive/master.zip zip archive under /root directory on the web1 node.

---
- name: Download and extract from URL
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
  -   unarchive:
       src: https://github.com/kodekloudhub/Hello-World/archive/master.zip
       dest: /root
       remote_src: yes

We have three files on web1 node /root/file1.txt, /usr/local/share/file2.txt and /var/log/lastlog. Create a bz2 archive of all these files and save it under /root directory, name the archive as files.tar.bz2. You can create ~/playbooks/files.yml playbook for it.

- name: Compress multiple files
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
  - archive:
     path:
      - /root/file1.txt
      - /usr/local/share/file2.txt
      - /var/log/lastlog
     dest: /root/files.tar.bz2
     format: bz2


We want to setup nginx on web1 node with some sample html code. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/nginx.yml to do so. Below are the details about the task:


a. Install nginx package and start/enable its service.

b. Extract /root/nginx.zip archive under /usr/share/nginx/html directory.

c. Inside /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html replace line This is sample html code with line This is KodeKloud Ansible lab.

- name: Install and configure nginx on web1
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
  - name: Install nginx
    yum: name=nginx state=installed
  - name: Start nginx
    service: name=nginx state=started enabled=yes

  - name: Extract nginx.zip
    unarchive: src=/root/nginx.zip dest=/usr/share/nginx/html remote_src=yes

  - name: Replace line in index.html
    replace:
     path: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
     regexp: This is sample html code
     replace: This is KodeKloud Ansible lab
