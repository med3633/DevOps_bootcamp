Step-by-Step Guide to Resolve the Issue:
Ensure EPEL Repository is Installed and Enabled:

Make sure the EPEL repository is correctly installed and enabled:

sh
Copier le code
sudo yum install epel-release -y
Check EPEL Repository Configuration:

Verify that the EPEL repository is enabled:

sh
Copier le code
sudo yum repolist
You should see the EPEL repository listed in the output. If not, you may need to manually enable it by editing the repository configuration file:

sh
Copier le code
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
Ensure that the following line is present and uncommented (remove the leading # if present):

ini
Copier le code
enabled=1
Clear Yum Cache:

Clear the yum cache to ensure it fetches the latest package information:

sh
Copier le code
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum makecache
Install Ansible Using EPEL:

After ensuring the EPEL repository is configured correctly, try installing Ansible again:

sh
Copier le code
sudo yum install ansible -y
If the EPEL repository still does not provide the Ansible package, you can manually install it using an alternative method.

Alternative Method: Install Ansible via PIP
Install Python and PIP:

Ensure Python and PIP are installed on your system:

sh
Copier le code
sudo yum install python3 python3-pip -y
Install Ansible Using PIP:

Use PIP to install Ansible:

sh
Copier le code
sudo pip3 install ansible
Verify the Installation:

Verify that Ansible is installed:

sh
Copier le code
ansible --version
Summary of Commands for Alternative Method:
sh
Copier le code
sudo yum install python3 python3-pip -y
sudo pip3 install ansible
ansible --version
By following these steps, you should be able to install Ansible on your Ansible controller, even if it's not available in the default Yum repositories.


For debugging purposes, we would like to configure Ansible to write logs to a different path than default. Configure Ansible to write logs to /var/log/ansible/ansible.log.
ChatGPT
To configure Ansible to write logs to a different path than the default, you'll need to adjust the logging configuration in the ansible.cfg file. Here's how you can do it:

Create the Log Directory:

First, create the directory where you want Ansible to write the logs:

sh
Copier le code
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/ansible
Edit the ansible.cfg File:

Open the ansible.cfg file in your preferred text editor. If you don't have one yet in your ~/playbooks directory, create it:

sh
Copier le code
nano ~/playbooks/ansible.cfg
Configure Ansible Logging:

Add or modify the following lines under the [defaults] section in the ansible.cfg file:

ini
Copier le code
[defaults]
inventory = /home/thor/playbooks/inventory
deprecation_warnings = False

[ssh_connection]
timeout = 60

[logging]
file = /var/log/ansible/ansible.log
[logging]: This section specifies the logging configuration.
file: Specifies the path where Ansible should write its logs. In this case, it's set to /var/log/ansible/ansible.log.
Save and Close the File:

Save the changes to the ansible.cfg file and close the text editor. For example, in nano, you can save by pressing CTRL + O and then CTRL + X to exit.

Example ansible.cfg File:
Your ansible.cfg file in the ~/playbooks directory should now look like this:

ini
Copier le code
[defaults]
inventory = /home/thor/playbooks/inventory
deprecation_warnings = False

[ssh_connection]
timeout = 60

[logging]
file = /var/log/ansible/ansible.log
Verify the Configuration:
To ensure the configuration is being applied correctly, you can run an Ansible command from the ~/playbooks directory:

sh
Copier le code
cd ~/playbooks
ansible --version
This command doesn't perform an operation but helps confirm that Ansible is using the ansible.cfg file from the correct location and thus should use the logging configuration specified there.

Notes:
Ensure that the directory /var/log/ansible exists and that the user running Ansible has write permissions to it.
Adjust the file path (file = /var/log/ansible/ansible.log) to fit your specific logging needs and system setup.
By following these steps, Ansible will now write its logs to /var/log/ansible/ansible.log as configured in the ansible.cfg file.
